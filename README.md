> This is Play Together Auto Fishbot.

# Caution
When the bait bites, the bot mechanism performs automatic fishing by searching the exclamation point image on the character + automatic fishing through keyboard control.
Therefore, there are some restrictions.

- BlueStacks always exists on the Windows screen.
- The BlueStacks screen exists at coordinates (0, 0).
- You cannot catch giant fish.

# Ability
- Automatic fishing of fish
- Fishing rod automatic repair
- KEEP mode to automatically store fish after fishing (emptying the fish box is manual when it is full)
- SELL mode that sells immediately after automatic fishing (**!!! Only works properly if you have an instant sell membership!!!**)

# Shortcut keys
- F1: Auto Fishbot ON OFF
- F2: Switch to KEEP mode (save fish after catching)
- F3: Switch to SEEL mode (sell fish after catching)
- F4: Quit

# Usage
1. Turn on Play Together.

2. Run main.exe

3. Move the character to the location for automatic fishing.

4. Wear the fishing rod you plan to use.

5. Press F1 to run the bot.

6. The bot throws a fishing rod.

7. When you move the mouse on the mirrored Enjoy Fish Bot screen, a square cursor will follow you. When you click on it, a red square box will appear on the screen.
   Click this red square box at the location where an exclamation mark appears above the character when a fish bites the bait to create a red square box.
   If you do not understand, please refer to Example 1, Example 2, and Example 3 in the example images.

9. Once the settings are complete, everything is done. Depending on the mode, the bot continues automatic fishing.


## Tips.
> How to increase exclamation mark recognition rate
  * As in the example images, it is a good idea to move the camera angle so that the red box is clearly captured with an empty background.


* Whenever you move the location of the fishing spot or change the camera angle, you need to set the red box again.
